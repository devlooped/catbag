# :cat:bag

A repository of loose helpers, base clases and assorted code that can be trivially referenced 
individually or by folders, using [dotnet-file](https://github.com/devlooped/dotnet-file).

> **cat**:  
> 1. [cat](http://www.linfo.org/cat.html) is one of the most frequently used commands on Unix-like operating systems. It has three related functions with regard to text files: displaying them, combining copies of them and creating new ones.
> 2. (bag): in spanish, "bolsa de gatos", which in Argentina is roughly "mixed bag", especially when 
> when referring to projects like Helpers and Common which everyone hates but can't quite avoid entirely.

You can efectively "cat" files from this repo straight into yours, and additionally keep them in sync trivially with `dotnet file update`. 

Each piece of functionality that extends the dotnet framework, is hereafter known as a üê±. Commits that introduce new features will use the `:cat:` prefix. Bug fixes to them will use `:cat::bug:` (:cat::bug:). If only introducing tests, we'll use `:test_tube:` (:test_tube:).
